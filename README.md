-----------------------

This repository is dedicated to showcasing the revolutionary capabilities of smart contracts, meticulously crafted for the realm of vehicle insurance. With a primary emphasis on usage-based policies, this resource provides an exploration of cutting-edge approaches, bridging the gap between traditional practices and the unleashed potential of Usage-Based Insurance (UBI) Smart Contracts. Using smart contracts empower companies and business owners in embracing innovative solutions that redefine the landscape of insurance services.

The templates provided in this repository serve as a comprehensive toolkit for implementing your business logic seamlessly. We have prioritized simplicity in deploying, initiating, creating, withdrawing, renewing, and terminating policies to facilitate a smooth and efficient process.

This repository is designed to cover the entire lifecycle of insurance policies, including
 deploying, initiating, creating, renewing, and terminating them. It provides thorough documentation and explanations for each transaction, catering to both insurance companies and self-creation business developers.

## Insurance Workflow

The workflow of issuance and renewal of vehicle insurance based on a blockchain network involves multiple steps to ensure transparency, security, and efficiency. Below is a general outline of the 3 workflow:

### 1- User Registration

Participants, including insurance companies, insured parties, and various stakeholders, begin their journey on the blockchain network by creating accounts and securing cryptographic key pairs.

**Prerequisites**: For insured parties operating as motus drivers, a seamless integration into the soarchain network is essential. This involves a series of steps that each insured party should follow:

1- Purchase a Motus Device (Motus mini) - For further details, please visit [Soarchain Shop](https://shop.soarchain.com/).

2- Complete registration by installing the Soarchai mobile app - Additional information is available at [Soarchain Official Website](https://www.soarchain.com/).

### 2- Smart Contract Deployment

Insurance companies deploy smart contracts on the blockchain to manage insurance policies. These smart contracts define the rules, terms, and conditions of insurance policies.

### 3- Issuance of Insurance Policy

When an insurance company needs to initiate a new insurance policy for a vehicle owner, they seamlessly interact with the smart contract. The smart contract, in turn, meticulously records vital policy details, including coverage specifics, premium amounts, and the duration of the policy.

### 4- Payment and Premium Collection

The insured individual makes a payment using cryptocurrency, and the smart contract verifies the payment. Once payment is confirmed, the smart contract updates the policy status to active.

### 5- Renewal Request

The insured individual initiates a renewal request by interacting with the smart contract. The smart contract may calculate a new premium based on various factors, such as the vehicle's history, market conditions, and any changes in coverage.

### 6- Premium Adjustment and Payment

If there are changes in the premium amount, the smart contract calculates the adjusted premium. The insured individual makes the payment, and the smart contract verifies the transaction.

### 7- Policy Renewal Confirmation

After successful payment, the smart contract updates the policy details, extending the policy duration. The renewed policy is now active.

### 8- Termination or Cancellation

The smart contract allows for termination or cancellation based on predefined conditions. For example, if an insured individual fails to make payments or violates terms, the smart contract may terminate the policy.

### 9- Transparency and Auditability

All transactions and policy-related activities are recorded on the blockchain, providing transparency and auditability. Participants can verify the history of a policy or transaction at any time.

### 10- Smart Contract Upgrades

Insurance companies may upgrade smart contracts to introduce new features, improve efficiency, or comply with regulatory changes.

It's essential to note that the specific steps and features of the workflow can vary based on the blockchain platform, smart contract language, and regulatory requirements. Additionally, security considerations, privacy, and compliance with local laws should be carefully addressed during the development and deployment of insurance-related smart contracts.
